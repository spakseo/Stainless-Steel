## FAQs
**Q1:** What is the difference between passivated and non-passivated stainless steel?
**A1:** Passivated stainless steel undergoes a chemical treatment that removes free iron and other contaminants from the surface, enhancing its corrosion resistance significantly compared to non-passivated steel.

**Q2:** Can I order custom dimensions for the passivated stainless steel strip?
**A2:** Yes, we offer custom orders to meet your specific requirements. Please contact us at +65 83016969 for more information.

**Q3:** How does the passivation process improve the performance of the steel strip?
**A3:** The passivation process forms a thin, transparent oxide layer on the surface of the steel, which acts as a barrier against corrosion, thus extending the life and durability of the product.

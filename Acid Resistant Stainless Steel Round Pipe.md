## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What is the difference between SS 316 and SS 316L?**
- **A:** SS 316 contains slightly more carbon than SS 316L, which makes SS 316L more resistant to intergranular corrosion. Both grades provide excellent corrosion resistance but SS 316L is preferred in welding applications to avoid sensitization.

**Q: Can I customize the length of the pipes?**
- **A:** Yes, we offer custom lengths to meet your specific project requirements. Please contact us for custom orders.

**Q: How do I maintain the pipes?**
- **A:** Regular cleaning with mild soap and water is sufficient. Avoid abrasive cleaners that could damage the surface finish.

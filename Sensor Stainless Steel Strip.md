## FAQs

**Q: What is the difference between 304, 316, and 316L grades?**
A: The main differences lie in their carbon content and corrosion resistance. 304 has the highest carbon content, while 316 and 316L have lower carbon content, with 316L having the lowest. This makes 316L the most resistant to corrosion, especially in marine environments.

**Q: How do I choose the right thickness and width for my application?**
A: The appropriate thickness and width depend on the specific requirements of your project. Factors such as load-bearing capacity, space constraints, and operational environment should be considered. Our technical team is available to assist you in selecting the best option.

**Q: Can I get custom sizes and shapes?**
A: Yes, we offer custom cutting and shaping services to meet your exact specifications. Please contact us with your requirements, and our team will provide a tailored solution.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### Q: What is the difference between grade 304 and grade 316 stainless steel?

**A:** Grade 304 stainless steel is widely used due to its excellent corrosion resistance and formability. It is suitable for a variety of applications where general corrosion resistance is required. Grade 316 stainless steel, on the other hand, contains molybdenum, which provides even greater corrosion resistance, making it ideal for more demanding environments such as marine and chemical processing applications.

### Q: How do I choose the right size and wall thickness for my application?

**A:** Choosing the correct size and wall thickness depends on the specific requirements of your project. Factors to consider include the pressure the pipe will withstand, the environment in which it will be installed, and the load it will bear. Our technical team can help guide you through this process to ensure you select the optimal specifications.

### Q: Can these pipes be customized to fit specific dimensions?

**A:** Yes, we offer customization services to meet your unique needs. Whether you require specific lengths, diameters, or wall thicknesses, our skilled technicians can produce custom stainless steel round pipes tailored to your exact specifications.

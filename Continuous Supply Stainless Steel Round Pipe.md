### Frequently Asked Questions

**Q1: What is the difference between grade 304 and 316 stainless steel?**

A1: Grade 304 is the most common type of stainless steel, offering excellent corrosion resistance and formability. Grade 316, on the other hand, contains molybdenum, which provides superior resistance to chlorides and pitting, making it ideal for more aggressive environments.

**Q2: How do I choose the right size and grade for my project?**

A2: Selecting the right size and grade depends on the specific requirements of your application. Factors such as pressure, temperature, corrosive environment, and load-bearing capacity should be considered. For guidance, consult with one of our technical experts at +65 83016969 or visit our showroom.

**Q3: Can you provide custom sizes?**

A3: Absolutely! We offer customization services to meet unique project needs. Whether you require specific lengths, wall thicknesses, or non-standard diameters, we can accommodate your requirements.

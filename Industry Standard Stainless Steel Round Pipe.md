**FAQs**

**Q: What is the difference between 304 and 304L stainless steel?**
A: Both 304 and 304L are types of austenitic stainless steel. The primary difference is that 304L has a lower carbon content, which makes it more resistant to intergranular corrosion after welding.

**Q: How do I choose the right size for my application?**
A: When selecting the appropriate size, consider the load-bearing requirements, space constraints, and specific application needs. If you need assistance, feel free to contact us at +65 83016969.

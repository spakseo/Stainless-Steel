Welcome to SD-Steel, your premier source for high-quality induction hardened stainless steel spring wire. Our product is designed to meet the most stringent demands of various industries, offering unparalleled strength and durability.

## Product Description
Induction Hardened Stainless Steel Spring Wire is engineered with precision to provide superior performance in demanding applications. This wire is made from premium quality stainless steel, ensuring it resists corrosion, wear, and tear. The induction hardening process enhances its hardness and fatigue resistance, making it ideal for use in harsh environments.

## Material Specifications
Our Induction Hardened Stainless Steel Spring Wire is made from high-grade stainless steel, typically AISI 304 or AISI 316, known for their excellent corrosion resistance. The wire undergoes an induction hardening process that increases its surface hardness without compromising its core ductility.

| Grade | Chemical Composition (%) | Hardness (HRC) |
|-------|--------------------------|----------------|
| AISI 304 | C: ≤0.15, Si: ≤1.00, Mn: ≤2.00, P: ≤0.045, S: ≤0.030, Cr: 18.00-20.00, Ni: 8.00-10.50 | 40-45 |
| AISI 316 | C: ≤0.08, Si: ≤1.00, Mn: ≤2.00, P: ≤0.045, S: ≤0.030, Cr: 16.00-18.00, Ni: 10.00-14.00, Mo: 2.00-2.50 | 40-45 |
